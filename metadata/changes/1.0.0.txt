2017-04-12 - 1.0.0

First tagged version.

The api was also modified, so that the subscriptions apis take the channel
they operate on as the first param in their signature.

A separate function (CreateMailbox) provides the channel and AddSub can be
removed.

Additionally two types were added:
1. Mailbox
Sends the topic to the receiving component, for further processing

2. Message
Send this struct instead of interface{}
